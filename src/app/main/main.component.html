  <h2 class="section">Overview</h2>
  <div class="descriptive">
    In "Lost in DragonSnot Falls" the characters travel Into the Closet and talk to Woodlynn, the Bee Queen. She tells them that her best friend, Niffle, has disappeared in DragonSnot Falls, and she's worried that he may have fallen into the wrong hands.
    <p>
      Niffle has fallen into the wrong hands - or the wrong claws, in this case! He's been captured by a group of saw-toothed witches. The witches are trying to find the dragon's stone heart so they can bring the dragon back to life. They think Niffle knows there it is, and they're holding him captive until he helps them find it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Players nust enter DragonSnot Falls, find the witches, and free Niffle from danger.

    As you lie sleeping, dreaming of something amazing, you feel your companion nudging you awake. You pull the blanket over your head and try to go back to sleep, but your companion hops up on the bed with you, bouncing up and down until you wake up.
    </p>
    <p>
    Once you're awake, you see your companion is holding out a piece of paper with a message.
    </p>
    <p>
    You know by the seal on the paper that it's a letter from your friend, Woodlynn, the Bee Queen of Into the Closet.

        As you walk through all od the clothes hanging in your closet, your shirts and pants and coats brush your face. Hangers rattle. You can see the back of the closet, and if you keep walking, you're afraid that you might walk right into it. And that your companion will walk right into you.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the closer you get, the more light you see. Your clothes turn into leaves and branches. The sound of hangars becomes the call of songbirds and the chitter of squirrels. You smell flowers and hear a river running somewhere far away.
      </p>
      <p>
        At last, you step out onto soft moss, and you are in a forest. Your friends are with you, each having came from their own bedrooms, each also carrying their gear. Your companions scamper about you, excited to be in a new place.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="ask">Ask the players to introduce their characters and companions to each other, especially if it's their first time playing together. You might have them read their sentence and their companion's sentance and then say their favorite thing about their character.</div>

        Just a few seconds later, a giant blue and yellow bee flies into view, holding a big ship in its feet. It seems to be part animal and part mechanical, and it's wearing goggles. When it gets near you, it starts to hover, staying in the same spot. It seems to take no notice of you, other than to bzzzt its wings a little bit as you get closer.

        Suddenly a ladder drops down, and you see someone waving at you from inside the ship. It's your friend, Woodlynn.
      </p>
      <p>"Come on up!" she yells.</p>
